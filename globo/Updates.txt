Good Morning mshindaji wa umbrella ya St Pauls :)
Ni vizuri unajikinga na ElNino, your thin self won't be carried away

What I managed to do:
- I received the ajax request as you told me and echoed a json, nothing was showing on console
- Made the products page view on category.php and attempted to display the products, brought that ka error. 
  I var dumped the array and left there, as I told you there was no internet, I couldn't debug vizuri
- Click on the categories link of every category on the category.php page, it changes accordingly
- Somehow I couldn't log in, ata haileti form. Something to do with the header smh

What is left:
- On cart.php no html table format was created since after logging out I couldn't log in
- Searching for products on category.php
- Forgot password
- This is all that is left according to the marking scheme...the rest are additional points

As you can agree, I made a lot of progress. Thanks for believing in me :)
