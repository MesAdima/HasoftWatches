- Click on category, takes you to home-map-grind.html
- The map to be replaced by the earlier page...(the kapart on top)

To be done today
- Receive ajax requests on haswatches.ajax.php from haswatches.js by using if(isset($_GET[value]))
- add the product id passed to cart by calling add to cart (addTocart() - PHP)
- if adding succeeds, encode a response in json and echo.

in cart.php,

- create a html table to show all items currently in my cart (logged in user) and sum the totals section.
- Thats all.

Not yet done
- searching products
- clicking on category to view all the products
- forgot password link

*Decided to remove welcomeuser.php it was echoing everything from the home page, I thought it was redundant
